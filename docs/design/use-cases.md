# Users

Users are stressed when using the computer

Needs:


# Scenarios / Use Cases


## Reminders to breathe while using the computer
Priority: Essential

Showing messages/pop-ups for the user

The user can easily switch between single phrases that are shown to the user
(if the user can easily switch between them it's less important to have a list of several)

### Collection of phrases
Priority: Low

These reminders can vary and be randomized from a collection, for example:
* Breathing in i know i am breathing in, out
* Breathing in i am aware of my body
* Breathing in ___________
* Also being able to select the percentage chance for each

Maybe this would be better in another application


## Remembering to take a break
Priority: *High*

A dialog window can be shown to remind the user to take a break.
This window can maybe also be used to select the new practice (when the user gets back).
(Does this mean that we instead want to show the main window by "restoring" it?)

The application might ask a question like this: "Do you want to take a break?"; "Not right now", "Yes"

A nice alternative to the above is to change the icon in the system tray area when it's time to
take a break, this makes it easier for the user to choose when to take the break

There could also be an audio notification (maybe a bell)


## Following the breathing
Priority: Essential

Using the shift key (or pressing a button with three states) to follow the breath graphically

### Sequential order of phrases
Priority: Medium

Q: What is the relation between this and "Collections of phrases" (above)


## Setting a positive intention and following up with questions later on
Priority: Medium

Remembering to be kind to oneself, doing things with "kindfulness"

Example:
* Was i peaceful in my body and mind?

### Remembering to take care of the body
Priority: Medium

For example by doing some mindful movements


## Remembering the purpose of the work at the computer
Priority: Low

Maybe we are contributing to social justice, mental well-being or something else, maybe
simply helping our colleagues?
