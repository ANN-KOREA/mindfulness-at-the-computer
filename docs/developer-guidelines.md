# Developer Guidelines

### Forums for interactions with other developers

* [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/mindfulness-at-the-computer/Lobby) - for real-time text chat
* Github - for code reviews and for commenting on issues.


### How to report bugs

TBD: Template for reporting bugs



### Decision process

* Overall design and architecture is determined by SunyataZero (Tord). In other words the project uses a so-called "benevolent dictatorship" structure. (Of course since this is free and open source software, anyone can - and are encouraged - to create a fork and create their own Mindfulness application which meets their needs‚ù£)
* We want discussions about all decisions to be very open in the project and therefore, conversations that have started out as private can be made public without asking the participants (unless of course the conversation has been of a very personal nature)

People:
* Tord

Money:
* People contributing to the project are unpaid


### Contributor responsibility

No responsibility for any financial or other damage.


### License

Mindfulness at the Computer is free and open-source software. The license used is GPLv3.


### How development is done

Please also see this document: [Getting Started](getting-started.md)

TBD: Ways of working


### Open conversation policy

Unless conversations are clearly of a private nature, we can choose to share them with other team members. The reason for this policy is so that it does not take too long to relay information to others (otherwise the person who wants to relay information would need to wait for an email response from the person she has been in conversation with).
