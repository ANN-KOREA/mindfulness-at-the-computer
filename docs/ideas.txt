idea: set a goal in the number of breaks to take each day


senaste tidsalternativet för breathing reminder interval time
ex: 30 sek, 60 sekunder
(kanske likadant för rest reminders)



[ ] put rest reminder progressbar in the status bar?

[ ] rest reminders: inspiring quotes etc
[ ] allow images instead of quotes, or create a third tab for just images?
[ ] add a nice and simple gradient background for the quotes?


insights into what is important with using the computer:
- contributing
- happy sitting here



***comparing with stillness buddy***
- adding a schedule with breaks?
-



messages in the status bar
"for best effect, please use a square (1x1) image"
"changes are automatically saved"


**ending the day with maybe deep relaxation**


***Advanced rules for what phrases are shown when***
Ex: Day of week and time of day

*Bells of mindfulness* - either as wisdom or in it's own area. These can be things that would
normally stress a person

***breathing: using the latest frequency to set breathing in and out in the system tray***


***Clicking on the notification to continue with the next phrase***



# Brainstorming
adding a bell every half an hour or so to remind the user to take breaks
alternatively the user can se a dialog

breathing button with three states: in, out, not active
toggle button

# Theoretical

Focus on mindfulness and resting, not on getting things done


# Tracking feelings
easy to change feelings, etc (feeling, mental formation, ___) from the system tray icon popup menu
notification when some time has passed, asking what the feeling, etc is now

# Background (theoretical):
*right intention/thinking*
right mindfulness
(right effort)

# temporary breathing text
and ability to add this later to the db
