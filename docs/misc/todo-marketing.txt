Hi,
i'm a buddhist practitioner since 15 years back and i'm also a computer software developer. I've been working on a mindfulness application for desktop computer which i call "Mindfulness at the Computer". It helps people who spend much time in front of the computer to stay mindful of their breathing and in touch with their body. It also reminds people to take breaks. You can find more info, screenshots and an alpha version (early version, not completed) here:

https://sunyatazero.github.io/mindfulness-at-the-computer/

This is free software, so anyone can use it cost-free and can even use the code i've written to write their own version of the program

Please note that this is an alpha version so it's maybe not ready for your list of mindfulness applications, but i wanted to share this in case you have suggestions where i can look for people interested to try it out and give feedback

Grateful for help and with kind regards,
Tord
Gothenburg, Sweden
