[ ] show the five/three latest selected phrases in the system tray menu
we could store the date and time that each phrase was last selected in the qlistwidget
maybe this is not needed, the user may not want to change this more often than opening
the application? or maybe the user wants to? hard to say, but this would be an interesting
challenge when writing the application, and it would probably change the db


=========


Low prio:
[ ] standardize how gui updates are made
[ ] standardize a naming system for handler methods (maybe ending with _m if they update the model?)
[ ] choosing a different directory for user files (to make it easier to backup)
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] marketing: adding a line in my email signature
[ ] testing
 * add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] when breathing starts, everything else is grayed out
[ ] using vbox.addSpacing(x) to separate parts of the interface (maybe this can replace the
horizontal lines?)
[ ] what to display in the system tray menu?

[ ] prio: don't change the current time until
1. the user presses the "reset timer" button
or
2. the current time has run out
[ ] "take a break now" resets the current timer
[ ] pause timer while the rest dialog is displayed
