[ ] build a system for updating gui as well as the icon, in a reliable and consistent way

[ ] Adding a button to the rest dialog for starting breathing after a break
        self.close_and_breathing_qpb = QtWidgets.QPushButton("Start Breathing")
        hbox.addWidget(self.close_and_breathing_qpb)

[ ] ***Alt: Integrating rest into the main window***

[ ] removing the numbers for lenght of in and out-breath, instead replacing with something
indicating which of these are active at the moment

[x] Windows: remove console window while running the application

[ ] .spec file should be generic and not contain the paths of a specific computer

[ ] adding a windows icon (.ico)

[ ] adding presets

=========


Low prio:
[ ] rest actions in the rest dialog?
[ ] indicate which breathing phrase is active in the sys tray. Please note: This means that we
may also need to include another value here, since the user may not have chosen one of the
top three / five
[ ] standardize how gui updates are made
[ ] standardize a naming system for handler methods (maybe ending with _m if they update the model?)
[ ] choosing a different directory for user files (to make it easier to backup)
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] marketing: adding a line in my email signature
[ ] testing
 * add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] when breathing starts, everything else is grayed out
[ ] using vbox.addSpacing(x) to separate parts of the interface (maybe this can replace the
horizontal lines?)
[ ] what to display in the system tray menu?

[ ] prio: don't change the current time until
1. the user presses the "reset timer" button
or
2. the current time has run out
[ ] "take a break now" resets the current timer
[ ] pause timer while the rest dialog is displayed
