[ ] change position (maybe using arrows from the icon set)
* move up, down
* move to top, bottom

[ ] choosing a different directory for user files (to make it easier to backup)
options:
show latest five, top five, chosen by the user
we could store the date and time that each phrase was last selected in the qlistwidget



[ ] standardize how gui updates are made
[ ] standardize a naming system for handler menthods (maybe ending with _m if they update the model?)

[x] showing time left, and take break now in the system tray menu
[x] disable/enable rest reminders
[x] disable/enable breathing reminders

[ ] show the five/three latest selected phrases in the system tray menu
figure out how to store this

[ ] bug: sometimes the time left is not updated when the rest dialog is closed
[ ] bug: strange slider error on windows, the slider jumps to and fro

=========

Low prio:
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] marketing: adding a line in my email signature
[ ] testing
 * add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] when breathing starts, everything else is grayed out
[ ] using vbox.addSpacing(x) to separate parts of the interface (maybe this can replace the
horizontal lines?)
[ ] what to display in the system tray menu?

[ ] prio: don't change the current time until
1. the user presses the "reset timer" button
or
2. the current time has run out
[ ] "take a break now" resets the current timer
[ ] pause timer while the rest dialog is displayed
