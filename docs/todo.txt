[x] moving the audio files to varia and removing the "play" function
[ ] creating downloads for windows
[x] reordering the system tray menu

[ ] rewriting the initial code so that almost the same code can be run from the
tests. One thing to look out for is the system tray menu code

[x] change position (maybe using arrows from the icon set)
* move up, down
* move to top, bottom

[ ] show the five/three latest selected phrases in the system tray menu
we could store the date and time that each phrase was last selected in the qlistwidget
maybe this is not needed, the user may not want to change this more often than opening
the application? or maybe the user wants to? hard to say, but this would be an interesting
challenge when writing the application, and it would probably change the db


[ ] standardize how gui updates are made
[ ] standardize a naming system for handler menthods (maybe ending with _m if they update the model?)

[x] showing time left, and take break now in the system tray menu
[x] disable/enable rest reminders
[x] disable/enable breathing reminders


[ ] bug: sometimes the time left is not updated when the rest dialog is closed
[ ] bug: strange slider error on windows, the slider jumps to and fro

=========

Low prio:
[ ] choosing a different directory for user files (to make it easier to backup)
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] marketing: adding a line in my email signature
[ ] testing
 * add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] when breathing starts, everything else is grayed out
[ ] using vbox.addSpacing(x) to separate parts of the interface (maybe this can replace the
horizontal lines?)
[ ] what to display in the system tray menu?

[ ] prio: don't change the current time until
1. the user presses the "reset timer" button
or
2. the current time has run out
[ ] "take a break now" resets the current timer
[ ] pause timer while the rest dialog is displayed
