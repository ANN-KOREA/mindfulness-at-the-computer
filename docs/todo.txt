[x] make the close and reset timer button larger

[ ] storing fonts in mcglobal

[ ] standardize a naming system for handler methods (maybe ending with _m if they update the model?)

[ ] Adding a button to the rest dialog for starting breathing after a break
        self.close_and_breathing_qpb = QtWidgets.QPushButton("Start Breathing")
        hbox.addWidget(self.close_and_breathing_qpb)

[ ] update icon to show if we are taking a break
(how to do this? should be pretty clear and easy to see)


=========


Low prio:
[ ] add some extra space after having paused
[ ] if the user only breathes in then the in breath will be removed

[ ] adding presets
[ ] adding a windows icon (.ico)
[ ] for x11: add hover functionality for the systray. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21795919/how-to-catch-the-mousehover-event-for-qsystemtrayicon
[ ] indicate which breathing phrase is active in the sys tray. Please note: This means that we
may also need to include another value here, since the user may not have chosen one of the
top three / five
[ ] choosing a different directory for user files (to make it easier to backup)
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] marketing: adding a line in my email signature
[ ] testing
 * add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] when breathing starts, everything else is grayed out
[ ] using vbox.addSpacing(x) to separate parts of the interface (maybe this can replace the
horizontal lines?)
[ ] what to display in the system tray menu?

[ ] prio: don't change the current time until
1. the user presses the "reset timer" button
or
2. the current time has run out
