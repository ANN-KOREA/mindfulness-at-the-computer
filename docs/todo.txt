[ ] always have a breathing phrase selected
[ ] store active breathing in db, alt: use topmost
Q: What about rest action?
? Using "breathing in i know i am breathing in, ..." as default when nothing is chosen?

[ ] adding the short breathing phrases to the breathing view "history"
* one advantage of doing this is that it encourages the user to breathe a full in and out breath mindfully
? do we want to show the short pause breathing stats with the half-width breathing bar?

? change to one button (rather than three?), but also giving the option to exit in a discrete way
in, out, close

[ ] show date and/or time in the breathing graphics view

[ ] increasing the timer from 30 secords to something better for the new breathing notifications
? do we want to keep the old breathing notificaiotn (non-interactive) pop-ups?

if we only have the new notification we could maybe allow no breathing phrase set
(or we could just use a default breathing phrase text)

Idea: using pop-up system tray notifications for taking a rest

horizontal breathing popup
hovering over the left and right areas

[x] adding hover over io labels, and extend labels to end of line

=========

types of notifications:
space (blocking or not),
how to close (and how "persistent")


Low prio:
[ ] draw a state diagram for the documentation
[ ] if the user only breathes in then the in breath will be removed
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] testing
 * add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] show the active breathing phrase in the systray menu
DESIGN: Deciding how to display (latest, top, something else?)
- another option is to show the entry with the surrounding entries (2 above and 2 below for example)
duplicate: [ ] indicate which breathing phrase is active in the sys tray. Please note: This means that we
may also want to include another value here, since the user may not have chosen one of the
top three / five
[ ] color change when the user moves the mouse or types, this is during the short breaks
- it's not possible to detect mouse outside of a widget in a cross-platform way,
but activity can be detected inside of the widget of course, and this is something that we
may (or not) want to use
