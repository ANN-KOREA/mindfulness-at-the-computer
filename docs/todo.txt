[ ] prio: don't change the current time until
1. the user presses the "reset timer" button
or
2. the current time has run out
[ ] "take a break now" resets the current timer

[ ] prio: update the breathing phrase main area as the user changes the phrases (in and out)

[ ] pause timer while the rest dialog is displayed

=========

Low prio:
[ ] adding logging - and removing print statements (except when the application starts perhaps?)
[ ] add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] when breathing starts, everything else is grayed out
[ ] using vbox.addSpacing(x) to separate parts of the interface (maybe this can replace the
horizontal lines?)
[ ] what to display in the system tray menu?
