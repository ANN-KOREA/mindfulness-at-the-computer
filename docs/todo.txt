[ ] design: recreate the systray menu

[x] design: add combobox to the breathing menu

[ ] add "test"/breathe now as an option both in the main user interface and in the systray menu

[x] skip break (same as wait for same nr of minutes as with "restart")

[x] add hover for the breathing dialog

[x] always have a breathing phrase selected
[x] set the top breathing phrase as the default
this approach is better than having a special case since if we have a special case we would
have to have a button for deselection if the user wanted to restore the special case. For
example, if the user speaks another language than English she may want to change to her own
language, or the user may simply prefer another phrase

? change to one button (rather than three?), but also giving the option to exit in a discrete way
in, out, close

2. walk mindfully and do the activity


=========


Low priority:
[ ] starting a 2nd program - same, in other words only one instance can be run
[x] draw a state diagram for the documentation
[x] if the user only breathes in then the in breath will be removed
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] show the active breathing phrase in the systray menu
DESIGN: Deciding how to display (latest, top, something else?)
- another option is to show the entry with the surrounding entries (2 above and 2 below for example)
duplicate: [ ] indicate which breathing phrase is active in the sys tray. Please note: This means that we
may also want to include another value here, since the user may not have chosen one of the
top three / five
