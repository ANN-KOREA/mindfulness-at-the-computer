[ ] color change when the user moves the mouse or types, this is during the short breaks
- it's not possible to detect mouse outside of a widget in a cross-platform way,
but activity can be detected inside of the widget of course, and this is something that we
may (or not) want to use


[x] auto expand docks with lists (vertically)

[ ] always have a breathing phrase selected
[ ] store checkbox state in db for auto-start breathing after break
[ ] store active breathing in db, alt: use topmost
Q: What about rest action?

[ ] close and minimize to tray
as an option to close and start breathing

[x] adding a windows icon (.ico)


[ ] draw a state diagram for the documentation

[ ] add some extra space after having paused
[ ] if the user only breathes in then the in breath will be removed


=========

Low prio:
[ ] indicate which breathing phrase is active in the sys tray. Please note: This means that we
may also want to include another value here, since the user may not have chosen one of the
top three / five
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] testing
 * add different test setups (no list items for example)
