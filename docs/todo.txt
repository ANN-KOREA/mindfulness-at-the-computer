[x] design: recreate the systray menu

[x] add "test"/breathe now as an option both in the main user interface and in the systray menu

? change to one button (rather than three?), but also giving the option to exit in a discrete way
in, out, close

2. walk mindfully and do the activity


=========


Low priority:
[ ] starting a 2nd program - same, in other words only one instance can be run
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] show the active breathing phrase in the systray menu
DESIGN: Deciding how to display (latest, top, something else?)
- another option is to show the entry with the surrounding entries (2 above and 2 below for example)
duplicate: [ ] indicate which breathing phrase is active in the sys tray. Please note: This means that we
may also want to include another value here, since the user may not have chosen one of the
top three / five
