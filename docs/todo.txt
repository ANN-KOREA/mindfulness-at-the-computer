[x] bugfix: updating the checkmarks in the systray when state changes

[ ] fullscreen of breathing area when breathing

[ ] close and minimize to tray
as an option to close and start breathing

[x] adding a windows icon (.ico)

[ ] store checkbox state in db
[ ] store active breathing in db, alt: use topmost

[ ] draw a state diagram for the documentation
[ ] update icon to show if we are taking a break
(how to do this? should be pretty clear and easy to see)

[ ] bold for: take break now, close and reset timer,
bold for important actions


[ ] add some extra space after having paused
[ ] if the user only breathes in then the in breath will be removed


=========

Low prio:
[ ] indicate which breathing phrase is active in the sys tray. Please note: This means that we
may also need to include another value here, since the user may not have chosen one of the
top three / five
[ ] setting the log level when starting the application, using a command line argument
[ ] testing
 * add different test setups (no list items for example)
[ ] don't change the current time until
1. the user presses the "reset timer" button
or
2. the current time has run out
