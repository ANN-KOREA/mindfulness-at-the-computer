[ ] prio: don't change the current time until
1. the user presses the "reset timer" button
or
2. the current time has run out
[ ] "take a break now" resets the current timer

[ ] prio: fix the whole enabled/disabled system for the application
[ ] *prio*: when breathing starts, everything else is grayed out
[ ] disable breathing reminders while following the breath,
and reset to previous state when the user "stops/clears"
+ distraction free mode when following the breath

[ ] making it easier to add new breathing entries,
making it easier to add new rest

[ ] add inline help text for new users

[ ] show rest action list settings in a dialog window instead - we maybe don't need this in the main window

[ ] using vbox.addSpacing(x) to separate parts of the interface (maybe this can replace the
horizontal lines?)
[ ] what to display in the system tray menu?
http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsystemtrayicon.html#setContextMenu

[ ] adding logging - and removing print statements (except when the application starts perhaps?)
[ ] add different test setups (no list items for example)

[ ] keyboard shortcuts for adding new list entries

[x] keyboard focus on breathing in for newly added breathing phrase

[ ] update the breathing phrase main area as the user changes the phrases (in and out)

[ ] pause timer while the rest dialog is displayed
