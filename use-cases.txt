# Scenarios / Use Cases

## Reminders to breathe while using the computer
Priority: **Essential**

Showing messages/pop-ups for the user

The user can easily switch between single phrases that are shown to the user
(if the user can easily switch between them it's less important to have a list of several

### Collection of phrases
Priority: Low

These reminders can vary and be randomized from a collection, for example:
* Breathing in i know i am breahing in, out
* Breathing in i am aware of my body
* Breathing in ___________
**Also being able to select the percentage chance for each**

Maybe this would be better in another application

## Following the breathing
Priority: **Essential**

Using the shift key (or pressing a button with three states) to follow the breath graphically

### Sequential order of phrases
Priority: Medium

Q: What is the relation between this and "Collections of phrases" (above)

## Setting a positive intention and following up with questions later on
Example:
* Was i peaceful in my body and mind?

## Remembering to take a break
Priority: *High*

A dialog window can be shown to remind the user to take a break.
This window can maybe also be used to select the new practice (when the user gets back).
(Does this mean that we instead want to show the main window by "restoring" it?)

The application might ask a question like this: "Do you want to take a break?"; "Not right now", "Yes"

A nice alternative to the above is to change the icon in the system tray area when it's time to
take a break, this makes it easier for the user to choose when to take the break

There could also be an audio notification (maybe a bell)

### Remembering to take care of the body
Priority: High/Medium

For example by doing some mindful movements


## Remembering to be kind to oneself
Priority:
This is what is already done in the other cases, but maybe we can add a heart or something that
reminds the user to do things with "kindfulness"
