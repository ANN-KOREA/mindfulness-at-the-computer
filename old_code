        Note that QDialog (and any other widget that has type Qt::Dialog) uses the parent widget
        slightly differently from other classes in Qt. A dialog is always a top-level widget,
        but if it has a parent, its default location is centered on top of the parent's top-level
        widget (if it is not top-level itself). It will also share the parent's taskbar entry.
